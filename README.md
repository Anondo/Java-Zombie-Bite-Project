## **Description:**
A kind of a platform game(though there are no real movements for the player :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:) built using 
java's built-in gui library Swing. The game starts with Rick Grimes([see here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Grimes)) as the 
hero taking on the waves of zombie attacks coming 4 at a time. The zombie speed increases as the players keeps scoring. They even 
starts to jump to avoid the bullets. A new breed of zombies starts to appear after the player have scored 150 or so. And an important
note: **DO NOT FORGET TO SHOOT THEM IN THE HEAD**.
